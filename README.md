    <p><b>PROBLEM STATEMENT:</b></p> 
    <p>Accidents and Injuries on construction sites are a significant concern, often resulting from workers not wearing proper safety gear. Traditional methods of monitoring safety gear compliance, such as manual inspections, can be time-consuming and error-prone. To address this challenge, a real-time monitoring system has to be developed which can significantly enhance safety by continuously tracking safety gear usage, potentially saving lives and reducing costs associated with accidents.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>OBJECTIVE:</b></p> 
    <p>The objective is to automate monitoring safety gear compliance, ensuring workers always wear appropriate safety gear. So this system will be a reliable solution to enhance workers' safety while streamlining the monitoring process for construction site supervisors.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>SOLUTION:</b></p> 
    <p>The solution to solve the problem is real-time monitoring and a feedback system that will detect safety gear usage and alert the supervisor at work.</p>

    <p><h3>The Intel oneAPI Toolkit</h3></p>
    <p><h4>Toolkit used: Intel® AI Analytics Toolkit (AI Kit) - Python 3 (Intel® oneAPI 2023.0)</h4></p>
     <p>We have utilized the Intel® AI Analytics Toolkit to optimize our model and achieve superior results. This toolkit can be used to 'Accelerate end-to-end data science and machine learning pipelines using Python* tools and frameworks'. Our project uses state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and Tensorflow which are optimized for the Intel architecture by the oneAPI platform. Intel(R) Extension for Scikit-Learn is also enabled to improve performance. The toolkit also supports several pre-trained models such as DenseNet, ResNet, YOLOv3, etc. By using this toolkit we can deliver high performance. Transfer learning with pre-trained models on Intel DevCloud for oneAPI has boosted our Safety Gear Detection System for Construction Workers, improving performance and accuracy. The detection part of the safety gear is performed on Intel DevCloud.</p>
